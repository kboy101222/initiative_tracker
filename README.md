# Initiative Tracker

A (soon to be) feature rich yet simple initiative tracker for TTRPGs, specifically Pathfinder and Dungeons & Dragons (or any system that uses that style of initiative)

The program is written in Dart and intended for PCs. Currently it's only for Linux, but a Windows version is planned for when I can bother to spin up a VM.

## To Do:
* ~~Health tracker~~
* Notes
* Status effects
* Dark Mode
* Windows Version
* ~~Turn tracking~~
* Automated testing
* Add groups of monsters together
